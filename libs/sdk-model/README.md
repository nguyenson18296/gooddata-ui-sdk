# SDK domain models

This package provides domain models for GoodData.UI.

These domain models are backend-agnostic. This makes them reusable across different Analytical Backend implementations.
The package includes TypeScript type definitions, factory functions, functions to get or set certain properties
of the objects in an immutable way, and more. These are used in both the `@gooddata/sdk-backend-*` and `@gooddata/sdk-ui* packages`.
