 * This package provides base functionality useful for building React visualizations on top of GoodData.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The functionality includes functions for getting data from the Analytical Backend,
 * components and React hooks that serve as building blocks for custom visualizations,
 * visualization definition placeholders, support for drilling, and so on.
 *
 * See the other `@gooddata/sdk-ui-*` packages (for example, `@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts`) for pre-built visualizations
 * that you can use instead of building your own.
