# GoodData.UI SDK - Core

This package provides base functionality useful for building React visualizations on top of GoodData.

The functionality includes functions for getting data from the Analytical Backend, components and React hooks that serve as building blocks for custom visualizations, visualization definition placeholders, support for drilling, and so on.

See the other `@gooddata/sdk-ui-*` packages (for example, [`@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts)) for pre-built visualizations that you can use instead of building your own.
