/**
 * A React hook that allows you to request and inform the dashboard about the rendering of a component
 * that is loaded asynchronously (eg Insight, Kpi, but in can be also any custom component).
 * In this way, the dashboard is able to recognize and notify that it is fully rendered.
 * (which is useful, for example, when exporting)
 *
 * Mechanism is following:
 * - You must request async rendering for at least 1 component within 2 seconds of the {@link DashboardLoaded} event.
 *   (If you do not register any asynchronous rendering, after 2 seconds the dashboard will announce that it is rendered.)
 * - You can request async rendering for any number of components. Requests are valid if the first rule is met
 *   and not all asynchronous renderings have been resolved and the maximum timeout (60s by default) has not elapsed.
 * - The component may again request asynchronous rendering within 2 seconds of resolution. Maximum 3x.
 *   (this is necessary to cover re-renders caused by data received from the component - eg pushData)
 *
 * Request async rendering of the component by calling onRequestAsyncRender() callback.
 * Resolve async rendering of the component by calling onResolveAsyncRender() callback.
 *
 * @internal
 * @param id - unique identifier of the component
 * @returns callbacks
